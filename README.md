# EasyRedBlackTree
This little library can be used for creation of a red-black search tree (see 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree for more information) and search queries. It is well 
suited for large data structures, since search, insert and delete actions have a complexity of log(n) if n is the 
number of nodes in the tree. It is very easy to use. Just copy the .c and.h file in your project folder.
